# Nginx Configuration

## Why We Use Nginx in the Balanced Project

Nginx serves as a critical component in our production architecture for several key reasons:

1. **Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing**: Nginx sits in front of our Next.js application container, efficiently routing incoming requests while enabling horizontal scaling of our app containers when needed.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Nginx excels at serving static content (JavaScript, CSS, images), taking this load off our Node.js application server and significantly improving response times.

3. **Security Layer**: By implementing Nginx as our outermost layer, we can filter malicious requests before they reach our application code, set up rate limiting, and prevent common attack vectors.

4. **SSL/TLS Management**: Rather than handling encryption in our application, we delegate this CPU-intensive task to Nginx, which is optimized for this purpose.

5. **HTTP/2 Support**: Nginx provides HTTP/2 capabilities with multiplexing and header compression, improving overall application performance.

6. **High Availability**: Nginx helps ensure application uptime through health checks and graceful handling of backend server issues.

7. **Caching Layer**: We utilize Nginx's built-in caching capabilities to reduce load on our application and database servers.

## SSL Termination

Is the process where HTTPS (encrypted) connections from clients are "terminated" at the Nginx server, which then forwards requests internally to your app servers over HTTP. This means:

- External traffic uses HTTPS (encrypted)
- Internal traffic between Nginx and your app can use HTTP (unencrypted, but within your private network)
- Nginx handles all the SSL/TLS certificate processing and encryption overhead

Benefits include:

- Reduced computational load on your app servers
- Centralized SSL certificate management
- Ability to inspect and modify traffic before it reaches your application

## SSL Certificates

SSL certificates are digital files that:

- Verify the identity of your website
- Enable encrypted connections between users and your server
- Are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs)
